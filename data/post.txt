Best Seven (7) office application for Android


<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;"> Office apps have been a valuable center of productivity for many years. We use them for a variety of purposes, including drafting documents, creating spreadsheets and presentations, and keep track of what's going on. No productivity suite is complete without them and virtually everybody uses them, even kids. The office suite atmosphere has changed very little the last few years. However, the application themselves are better than they used to be. Here are the current best office application for Android! </span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;">There’s a chance that none of the office apps on this list work for you. If that’s the case, you may want to pick up something like Chrome Remote Desktop. This application allows you to remote into your computer and use your computer like you normally would, except on your phone. It probably works best with tablets and with things like a Bluetooth keyboard, but you can access your office apps on your PC from your Android device, potentially bypassing the need for an office suite at all. It’s completely free to use. Teamviewer is another good application to do this. It doesn't require Google Chrome to use.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;">Docs to Go is an older app that’s been around for quite some time. However, it's still receiving new features and updates. It has the basics, such as word processing, spreadsheet editing, and presentation editing. It does an excellent job of letting you do these things without too much of a setup. The paid version unlocks password-locked files, saving to (and loading from) cloud storage sites, and file syncing with your desktop. It’s not great in every situation, but it's one of the more solid office application's.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;">OfficeSuite is a long time favorite for many people. The application has changed a lot from its early days. Currently, the developers seem to be transitioning the suite into something closer to Google Drive or Microsoft OneDrive. The idea is to have a cloud storage hub from which to work. Most of the basic features are available in the free version and that's good news. The paid version allows for PDF scanning, a font pack that’s compatible with Microsoft, a spell checker, and additional document support. It's one of the better run-of-the-mill office application's. It is also among the most expensive.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;">Smart Office 2 is another one of the rare free office application. The application used to cost money. However, at some point, they decided to let it go for free. It comes with all of the basic features as you’d expect, including support for word processing, spreadsheets, and presentations. It also comes with support for Microsoft Office documents from 2013 and back. You can also use it to view (and save) PDF files, some image files, and WMF and EMF file types. The interface is clean and simple. It's a good option for those who don't need much.</span>

They also have a suite of paid office apps. Both of them are pretty good. There are three apps in the suite, including TextMaker, PlanMaker, and Presentations which are just funny names for word processor, spreadsheet, and, well, presentations. Unlike most, the apps are completely free. Their features include PDF support, TrueType and OpenType fonts, and support for (most) Microsoft file types. You'll have to buy the paid versions of the apps separately. On the plus side, you can only buy what you need. On the negative side, all three application costs about $15.</span>

<span style="font-size: 18px; line-height: 20px; color: white;">Google Drive is a favorite among our readers and many others. It has a whole suite of office apps, including a PDF Viewer, Google Docs, Google Sheets, Google Slides, and, of course, Google Drive. Drive services as the hub. It's really just a cloud storage app where you can view your files or make new ones. Opening any document in your Google Drive will automatically open the appropriate app. It’s all completely free unless you need to expand your Google Drive space. All the apps are also quite simple to use. It's a good all-in-one solution for most people.</span>
